# diceGameIos
A simple dice game using SwiftUI and Xcode. You can play alone or take turns with someone. It also displays the game data - how many times have you played, how many times have you won and what is the winning %


## Motivation
I wanted to know how Xcode works and what is the syntax for SwiftUI.

## What have I achieved so far?
* Player one works, it calculates the points together, displays points, changes the dice picture, re-start button works, start-the-game button works
* Player one score sheet displays data about - how many times you have played, how many times you have won and what is the % of the wins
* Two player game is taking turns, calculates the points together, shows the points, shows who has won\lost, re-start game button is working, start the game button is working 

## How can I make the project better?
* Two-player game datasheet needs correcting - it is not displaying the data correctly
* Make the design better
* Add more players


## Tech/framework used
* Xcode v11.1


## Installation
You need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)


## How to use?
